<div id="histogram" style="text-align: center;">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        Firstly, we decide to analyse the histogram of the numerical attributes in our dataset, inculding "imdb score",
        "tmdb score", "imdb votes", "release year", "runtime", and "seasons". <br>
        From the plot of release year, we found that most of the TV series or shows are produced in recent years,
        especially after 2019.
    </p>
    <p>This is the histogram, please select an attribute or/and the number of bins </p>
    <!-- add a selecting list -->
    <g></g>
    <label for="attributeSelect">Select Attribute:</label>
    <select id="attributeSelect"></select>
    <g class="slider-container">
        <label for="binsSlider" class="slider-label">Number of Bins:</label>
        <!-- <input type="range" id="binsSlider" min="1" max = "71" value="10"> -->
        <input type="range" id="binsSlider" min="1" value="10">
        <span id="binsValue">10</span>
    </g>
</div>
<div id="histogram_categorical">
    <p>This is the count by genres. The most popular genres of productions are comedy and drama, both of them have more
        than 2000 production in our Netflix datasest. The genres with least number of productions are war, sports and
        western, it can be concluded that Netflix is more focused on comedy or drama rather than western, war and sport
        type of content. This could be the result of the influence from costumers' interest and from the producers'
        working field.</p>
</div>
<div id="treemap_categorical">
    <p>This is the count by genres presented in a tree map. </p>
</div>
<div id="GenreByTime">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        Afterwards, the percentage of production for each genre by time is analysed. Time range is from 1953 to 2021,
        since there isn't any data for 1949 to 1953 this period is ignored when we process the data. <br>
        Some genres has been produced throughout time, such as crime or drama; some genres started to be produced later,
        such as animation or science fictions, they begins to make this type of productions after the application of
        computers in film industry or TV series studios. Some genres only appears during some specific time period, for
        example, most western genres are added to Netflix database around 1960s due to their representation of cultural
        sentiments.
    </p>
</div>
<div id="GenreNet">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        a network of genres
    </p>
</div>
<div id="histogram_CountCountry">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        This is the count by Country, the top 30 countires with most number of productions in Netflix dataset are
        plotted. The united states produced most, more than 3 times than the second one (India), and United Kingdom (
        Great Britain) ranked number 3. Since Netflix is an American company, it is expected that it covers more
        productions from US and English-speaking countries.
    </p>
</div>
<div id="correlation">
    <p>This is the correlation between imdb score, tmdb score, release year, runtime and
        tmdb popularity. Release year is slightly negatively correlated to both imbd score and runtime. It is reasonable
        that consumers prefer recently released films or shows, and due to the technical constraints, very old films and
        show has less runtime than recent productions.<br>
