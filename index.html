    <h2>World Map of Netflix Movies and Shows<span class="subtitle">Author: Berenice Jaulmes</span></h2>
    <p>
        For the visualisation of the number of movies per country, we used an interactive world map. When hovering over
        a country, the user can see its name and the total number of Netflix movies produced there. We chose to use a
        blue and red color scheme to make the countries that produce few movies stand out from the countries for which
        there is no data. This was more difficult to achieve with a one-color scheme. A special library was used for
        this map, namely TopoJSON.

    <h2>Ridgeline Plot for Review Score Distribution Analysis<span class="subtitle">Author: Chenwei Wan</span></h2>
    <p>In this section, we employ a ridgeline plot to elucidate the
        distribution of review scores across various genres. This
        visualization is enhanced by a diverging color scheme, which is
        aligned with the mean review scores to distinctly highlight genres
        with comparatively higher or lower ratings. These ratings are
        aggregated from two prominent film review platforms: IMDb and TMDb.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the plot offers two distinct sorting options for users:
        an alphabetical arrangement of genres and an ordering based on their
        mean scores. Enhanced interactivity is a pivotal feature of this
        visualization. Specifically, when users hover over any section of
        the density plot, the corresponding area is accentuated through a
        change in opacity, an emboldening of the ridgeline, and a display of
        the genre’s mean score. This interactive element is designed to
        provide an informative user experience, facilitating a deeper
        understanding of the data.</p>

<h2>Disjoint Graph for Collaborative Relationships<span class="subtitle">Author: Chenwei Wan</span></h2>
<p>As to the modelling of collaborative relationships between actors and
    directors, we first introduce our data-mining strategy. We define
    'popularity' for actors and directors based on their participation
    in a minimum of four movies or shows. We then establish a network to
    map collaboration relationships, exclusively considering 'strong
    collaborations' characterized by at least four joint projects.</p>
<p>In our network visualization, directors are represented by orange
    nodes, while actors are depicted with blue nodes. The strength of
    each collaborative link is quantified by the number of joint projects
    and visually represented by the stroke of the edge.Given the presence
    of multiple disjoint subgraphs within the network,
    we employ a disjoint force-directed graph approach, which enables us
    to maintain the visibility of separate subgraphs within a single
    viewport, facilitating comprehensive analysis. Further enhancing the
    utility of this visualization, we have integrated an interactive
    feature: when a user hovers over any node or link in the graph,
    a tooltip window is triggered. This window provides detailed
    information, such as the name of the actor or director represented
    by a node, or the complete list of collaborative projects associated
    with a link between two nodes. This interactive component of the
    visualization gives users a deeper understanding of the collaborative
    dynamics within the network.</p>

<div id="correlation">
    <h2>Heatmap for General Feature Correlations<span class="subtitle">Author: Wen Yang</span></h2>
    <p>This is the correlation between imdb score, tmdb score, release year, runtime and
        tmdb popularity. Release year is slightly negatively correlated to both imbd score and runtime. It is reasonable
        that consumers prefer recently released films or shows, and due to the technical constraints, very old films and
        show has less runtime than recent productions.<br>
    </p>
</div>
<h2>Scatterpoint Graph for Detailed Correlation Analysis<span class="subtitle">Author: Chenwei Wan</span></h2>
<p>In this section, we present a scatterplot to analyze the correlation
    between popularity and review scores of media content. Considering
    the significant variation in the distribution of popularity data,
    the scatterplot is equipped with a scale that users can toggle
    between linear and logarithmic, enhancing the visual interpretability
    of the data. The scatterplot is enriched with a linear color scheme,
    which corresponds to the release year of the media content. Distinct
    shapes are utilized to differentiate between movies and shows.</p>
<p>To further aid in the comparative analysis of movies and shows, a
    histogram is displayed beneath the scatterplot. This histogram shows
    the count of different Netflix media types. Interactivity is a
    key feature here: when users select either of the bars in the
    histogram, the scatterplot dynamically updates to display only
    the data points corresponding to the selected media type. Moreover,
    when users hover over a data point in the scatterplot, a tooltip
    window appears, providing the name of the media. This design not
    only enhances user engagement but also offers insightful and
    tailored views of the data.</p>

<div id="histogram" style="text-align: center;">
    <h2>Histogram for Numerical Features<span class="subtitle">Author: Wen Yang</span></h2>
    <p>
        Netflix dataset contains both numerical attributes and categorical attributes, in order to study the showing
        general
        distributional features for those attributes, we proposed to create histograms for numerical attributes.
        Histograms
        reflects the count of occurrences in the dataset for each logical range or bins.</p>
    <p>
        To deal with numerical attributes, the visualization for histogram is created with d3.histogram() for setting
        the parameters and with d3 “rect” element for building the chart. The height of rectangles represents the count
        of occurrence and the width represents the value of the attribute. The video on Netflix could be TV shows or
        movies and the different natures of shows and movies, such as different runtimes, our histogram is designed in
        an
        interactive way by varying the colors of the rectangles representing each type, when chosen one type of the
        video,
        the corresponding histograms’ color can be highlighted. Also, by stacking the bars of histogram, this
        visualization
        could provide a global description for the numerical attributes in this dataset. In addition, we integrated a
        slider
        and a drop-down menu list for users to choose the attribute and choose the desired number of bins in the
        histograms.
    </p>
    <!-- add a selecting list -->
    <g></g>
    <label for="attributeSelect">Select Attribute:</label>
    <select id="attributeSelect"></select>
    <g class="slider-container">

        <!-- <input type="range" id="binsSlider" min="1" max = "71" value="10"> -->
        <input type="range" id="binsSlider" min="1" value="10">
        <span id="binsValue">10</span>
    </g>
</div>
<h2>Bar Charts for Categorical Attributes<span class="subtitle">Author: Wen Yang</span></h2>
<p>
    For the categorical attributes, bar charts are plotted to show the count of occurrences in Netflix dataset for each
    category. To deal with categorical attributes, the visualization is realized by creating a bar chart using d3 ”rect”
    element, with the height representing the count of occurrences of different categories. The position of each bar is
    ordered by their count in descending order. This sorted bar chart allow us to know which category has the most
    count, and provide a comparison between different categories.
</p>
<div id="histogram_categorical">
    <p>This graph presents the number of productions in each genres. The most popular genres of productions are comedy
        and drama, both of them have more than 2000 production in our Netflix datasest. The genres with least number
        of productions are war, sports and western, it can be concluded that Netflix is more focused on comedy or drama
        rather than western, war and sport type of content. This could be the result of the influence from costumers’
        interest and from the producers’ working field.</p>
</div>
<div id="histogram_CountCountry">
    <p>
        We calculated the number of productions in each country and show the top 30 countries in terms of their number
        of productions. The united states produced most, more than 3 times than the second one (India), and
        United Kingdom (Great Britain) ranked number 3. Since Netflix is an American company, it is expected that it
        covers more productions from US and English-speaking countries.
    </p>
</div>
<div id="treemap_categorical">
    <h2>Treemap for Genres<span class="subtitle">Author: Wen Yang</span></h2>
    <p>Treemap is a visualization method for displaying hierarchical data. It uses nested rectangles to represent the
        branches of a tree diagram. Each rectangle has an area proportional to the amount of data it represents. In our
        case, we have limited hierarchical structure in our dataset, as a result, each genre is represented as one leaf
        node
        and they all have the same level of hierarchy, all of them are connected to the root node in this graph.
        The rectangles are filled with different colors to differentiate each genre. With a text element on each
        rectangle
        showing the genre and its count, treemap allows to easily identify the most and the least popular genres. Some
        genre with a very small count is represented by a very small rectangle, and the text will exceed the border of
        the
        rectangle, therefore, a clip function is used to constrain the location of the text element. This type of could
        be even
        more useful when illustrating hierarchical data.</p>
</div>
<div id="GenreByTime">
    <h2>Stacked Area Chart for Genres over Time<span class="subtitle">Author: Wen Yang</span></h2>
    <p>
        Stacked area chart displays the evolution of the value of several groups on the same graphic. The values of each
        group are displayed on top of each other, which allows to check on the same figure the evolution of the
        importance
        of each group
    </p>
    <p>
        In this figure, the percentage of production of each genre throughout time is analysed. The fully-stacked height
        of the topmost line corresponds to the total when summing across all genres, in our case is 100%. Comparing
        the heights of each segment of the curve provides a general idea of how each genre compares to the other in
        their
        contributions to the total. In practice, this chart loses information about the trend of the absolute counts but
        helps
        to bring out the comparison of relative contributions between genres. The data are prepossessed before plotting
        the chart. Firstly, an aggregating by genre is performed, then we compute the sum of each time period and obtain
        the percentage of each genre during this period. Secondly, area charts are generated with d3.stack() and
        d3.area()
        function draw the area and stack areas together. At last, each genre is assigned with a different color by a
        customed
        color scale to differentiate them between each other.

</div>
<div id="GenreNet">
    <h2>Chord Diagram for Genre Overlaps<span class="subtitle">Author: Wen Yang</span></h2>
    <p>
        The co-appearance of different genres is also studied. One movie or one TV show may belongs to several genres at
        the same time. For this kind of analysis, we propose to use chord diagram. A chord diagram represents
        connections
        between several nodes. In our case, each genre is represented by a node. And it is shown as a fragment on the
        outer
        part of the circular layout. The length of this circular fragment corresponds to the percentage of the count for
        this
        genre among the summation of all counts. And each genre has a different color, which makes them distinguished
        from each other. Then, arcs are drawn between each nodes. The width of the arc is proportional to the count of
        co-appearance the between two genres.
