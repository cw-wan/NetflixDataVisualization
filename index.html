<h1>Data Visualization for Netflix TV Shows and Movies</h1>
<!-- Author: Chenwei Wan -->
<div id="genreImdbDistribution">
    <p>In this section, we employ a ridgeline plot to elucidate the
        distribution of review scores across various genres. This
        visualization is enhanced by a diverging color scheme, which is
        aligned with the mean review scores to distinctly highlight genres
        with comparatively higher or lower ratings. These ratings are
        aggregated from two prominent film review platforms: IMDb and TMDb.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the plot offers two distinct sorting options for users:
        an alphabetical arrangement of genres and an ordering based on their
        mean scores. Enhanced interactivity is a pivotal feature of this
        visualization. Specifically, when users hover over any section of
        the density plot, the corresponding area is accentuated through a
        change in opacity, an emboldening of the ridgeline, and a display of
        the genreâ€™s mean score. This interactive element is designed to
        provide an informative user experience, facilitating a deeper
        understanding of the data.</p>

<p>As to the modelling of collaborative relationships between actors and
    directors, we first introduce our data-mining strategy. We define
    'popularity' for actors and directors based on their participation
    in a minimum of four movies or shows. We then establish a network to
    map collaboration relationships, exclusively considering 'strong
    collaborations' characterized by at least four joint projects.</p>
<p>In our network visualization, directors are represented by orange
    nodes, while actors are depicted with blue nodes. The strength of
    each collaborative link is quantified by the number of joint projects
    and visually represented by the stroke of the edge.Given the presence
    of multiple disjoint subgraphs within the network,
    we employ a disjoint force-directed graph approach, which enables us
    to maintain the visibility of separate subgraphs within a single
    viewport, facilitating comprehensive analysis. Further enhancing the
    utility of this visualization, we have integrated an interactive
    feature: when a user hovers over any node or link in the graph,
    a tooltip window is triggered. This window provides detailed
    information, such as the name of the actor or director represented
    by a node, or the complete list of collaborative projects associated
    with a link between two nodes. This interactive component of the
    visualization gives users a deeper understanding of the collaborative
    dynamics within the network.</p>
<div id="actorsRelationship">
</div>
<p>In this section, we present a scatterplot to analyze the correlation
    between popularity and review scores of media content. Considering
    the significant variation in the distribution of popularity data,
    the scatterplot is equipped with a scale that users can toggle
    between linear and logarithmic, enhancing the visual interpretability
    of the data. The scatterplot is enriched with a linear color scheme,
    which corresponds to the release year of the media content. Distinct
    shapes are utilized to differentiate between movies and shows.</p>
<p>To further aid in the comparative analysis of movies and shows, a
    histogram is displayed beneath the scatterplot. This histogram shows
    the count of different Netflix media types. Interactivity is a
    key feature here: when users select either of the bars in the
    histogram, the scatterplot dynamically updates to display only
    the data points corresponding to the selected media type. Moreover,
    when users hover over a data point in the scatterplot, a tooltip
    window appears, providing the name of the media. This design not
    only enhances user engagement but also offers insightful and
    tailored views of the data.</p>

<div id="histogram" style="text-align: center;">
    <p>
        Firstly, we decide to analyse the histogram of the numerical attributes in our dataset, inculding "imdb score",
        "tmdb score", "imdb votes", "release year", "runtime", and "seasons". <br>
        From the plot of release year, we found that most of the TV series or shows are produced in recent years,
        especially after 2019.
    </p>
    <p>This is the histogram, please select an attribute or/and the number of bins </p>
    <!-- add a selecting list -->
    <g></g>
    <label for="attributeSelect">Select Attribute:</label>
    <select id="attributeSelect"></select>
    <g class="slider-container">
        <label for="binsSlider" class="slider-label">Number of Bins:</label>
        <!-- <input type="range" id="binsSlider" min="1" max = "71" value="10"> -->
        <input type="range" id="binsSlider" min="1" value="10">
        <span id="binsValue">10</span>
    </g>
</div>
<div id="histogram_categorical">
    <p>This is the count by genres. The most popular genres of productions are comedy and drama, both of them have more
        than 2000 production in our Netflix datasest. The genres with least number of productions are war, sports and
        western, it can be concluded that Netflix is more focused on comedy or drama rather than western, war and sport
        type of content. This could be the result of the influence from costumers' interest and from the producers'
        working field.</p>
</div>
<div id="treemap_categorical">
    <p>This is the count by genres presented in a tree map. </p>
</div>
<div id="GenreByTime">
    <p>
        Afterwards, the percentage of production for each genre by time is analysed. Time range is from 1953 to 2021,
        since there isn't any data for 1949 to 1953 this period is ignored when we process the data. <br>
        Some genres has been produced throughout time, such as crime or drama; some genres started to be produced later,
        such as animation or science fictions, they begins to make this type of productions after the application of
        computers in film industry or TV series studios. Some genres only appears during some specific time period, for
        example, most western genres are added to Netflix database around 1960s due to their representation of cultural
        sentiments.

<div id="GenreNet">
    <p>
        a network of genres
    </p>

<div id="histogram_CountCountry">
    <p>
        This is the count by Country, the top 30 countires with most number of productions in Netflix dataset are
        plotted. The united states produced most, more than 3 times than the second one (India), and United Kingdom (
        Great Britain) ranked number 3. Since Netflix is an American company, it is expected that it covers more
        productions from US and English-speaking countries.
    </p>
</div>
<div id="correlation">
    <p>This is the correlation between imdb score, tmdb score, release year, runtime and
        tmdb popularity. Release year is slightly negatively correlated to both imbd score and runtime. It is reasonable
        that consumers prefer recently released films or shows, and due to the technical constraints, very old films and
        show has less runtime than recent productions.<br>
